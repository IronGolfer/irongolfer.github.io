<p>First target community will be golfers at Purdue and the surrounding areas. Along with reaching out to businesses (i.e. CAT) and maybe making corporate accounts on the app and with the golf courses if they do not already have something similar. The zip code is our’s 47906. Our demographics are anyone who wants to golf, but it will be more for the 18-46 year olds, either independent, or wanting to take friends or clients, along with senior citizens. 

A dedicated sales staff targeting country clubs and other companies, student interns to market our product to consumers, and all of us in the group advising different aspects of the sales/marketing effort.</p>
